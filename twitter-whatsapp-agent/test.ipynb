      "[Document(page_content='I built a little app recently to help me map my mind. It shoots me a series of texts every few hours that asks me questions about what’s going on: thoughts, feelings, emotions. It also sends a follow-up with a big question I’m currently wrestling with: “What’s your big goal?” When I get these texts, I dash off a few quick responses without thinking about it too much. I want to get as close to the snap answers that come to mind, and then move on with my day.\\n\\nThe cool thing about the app is that it then uses AI to generate a summary of what’s on my mind. It helps me see, day to day, what I’m thinking about and feeling. It also tries to condense a definitive answer to big questions I’m wrestling with—taking into account all of the different ways I’ve answered it—and provides observations about patterns it finds in my answers.\\n\\nIt’s been quite helpful for me.\\n\\nI was chatting with my friend, Every writer, coach, and fellow psychology nerd Casey Rosengren about the app recently and he asked if he could try it. I tensed up a bit at the amount of work required.\\n\\nSee, it’s currently very easy to build something like this for one person. But making it available for multiple people is a harder problem. In order to do this I’d have to implement logins, make the code multiplayer, build an interface to let him customize questions, and make sure my data doesn’t get mixed in with his. Especially for an app like this, where you’re sharing private thoughts, it’s just a bit of a hairball.\\n\\nBut then I had a little brainwave. I had built the app on Replit—so the problem was already solved.\\n\\nReplit is an all-in-one browser-based development and deployment environment. It allows you to code an app, and press one button to host it live on the internet.', metadata={'start_index': 5246}), Document(page_content=\"Brought to you by Designing Your Next Career Step Embark on a transformative 2-week Designing Your Next Career Step Course led by Simone Stolzoff, a leading figure from IDEO and author of 'The Good Enough Job'.

It’s as if you’ve figured out how to rent the same hotel room to many guests at a time through some weird tricks of quantum superposition. It is the greatest business in the world.\\n\\nCustomers pay for your hotel room by the month. Each one gets the same basic setup: bed, desk, and Wi-Fi that never works when you need it. When you make changes to the core room, all guests get the new version. But they can also request customizations personal to them, like a wake-up call—5 am for the gym rats, 1 pm for the barflies. Guests tend to stay for months or years at a time, paying for the same room as everyone else.\\n\\nIt is an absolute license to print money.\\n\\nQuantum hotel rooms are not all roses and free cash flows though. There are two crucial things to know about being the owner/proprietor of a business like this. The first is that transitioning from a single-user room to infinite occupancy takes effort. Your quantum superposition technology is a little complex to build. The second is that the longer you’re in business the more of your time and money you’re going to spend enabling “personalizations” for each guest. In the end, each guest customizes your hotel room so much that it looks like their own home.\\n\\nThis is very expensive and frustrating to deal with, but you console yourself by wiping your tears with stacks of thousand-dollar bills.\", metadata={'start_index': 0}), Document(page_content=\"Suddenly, instead of building a single-room quantum hotel, you’re building a suburban development. All of the houses on the block are in the same style, and you can build a new one for a new renter at the touch of a button. When renters move in, they can customize the house themselves without requiring any of your time or money—and without affecting any of the other houses.\\n\\nThis vision of software turns traditional SaaS into something far more bespoke, customizable, and remixable than the current generation of software allows for. The computer science researcher, Geoffrey Litt, who I interviewed here, calls this Malleable Software. I’ve been calling it Malleable Source. Malleable source means any app that allows you to modify its underlying code with AI. These apps can be open-source or closed.\\n\\nIt’s clear that this is a new paradigm on the horizon.
