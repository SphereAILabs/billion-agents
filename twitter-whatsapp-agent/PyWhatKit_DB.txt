Message: One key insight from the article is that the future of software is shifting towards more bespoke, customizable, and remixable applications. The concept of 'Malleable Software' or 'Malleable Source' is introduced, which refers to apps that allow users to modify their underlying code with the help of AI. This new paradigm blurs the line between app users and developers, potentially leading to diverse and personalized software experiences. Additionally, this shift could result in the rise of indie or micro SaaS apps and more individuals and businesses choosing to build their own software rather than relying on pre-existing vendors.
